# Mephisto

Mephisto is a Mozilla Firefox 4 Add-On that adds an HTTP server inside your
browser. This server is able to open webpages and returns content information
or screenshots.

Common tools like curl or urllib2 will only give you the main HTML code of a
webpage. On many websites, this source code is not the final document given to
the user as some script may have modified it. Sometimes you want to check the 
validity of your document based on some criteria. Your source could be OK but 
your DOM a terrible mess.
